# 💳 Credit Card Transactions & Fraud Analysis  

 *End-to-End Data Analysis Project* | SQL • Power BI • Data Storytelling
<br><br>


## 🌟 Project Overview  
This project analyzes *2,83,726 credit card transactions* to detect fraudulent activity and uncover spending patterns.  
Using *SQL* for data processing and *Power BI* for visualization, the project simulates a real-world fraud detection workflow used in banking & finance.
The goal is to help financial institutions identify suspicious activity faster and reduce fraud loss
<br><br>


## 🎯 Key Results & Impact  
✅ *283K+ transactions analyzed* (Fraud + Non-Fraud)  
✅ Fraud rate: *0.83%*, but with high monetary impact  
✅ Detected *small-test fraud pattern* — $1–$19 transactions before larger frauds  
✅ Identified *peak fraud hours*: ⏰ 11:00 AM & 2:00 PM  
✅ Developed an *interactive, drill-through Power BI dashboard*  
<br><br>


## 🛠 Tech Stack  
| Tool      | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| *SQL*   | Data cleaning, transformation & fraud pattern analysis |
| *Power BI* | Interactive fraud monitoring dashboard |

<br><br>


## 📈 Key Insights  
🔍 *Fraud is rare, but costly* — representing <1% of transactions yet with high-value cases  
💡 *Low-value “test” transactions* often precede high-value fraudulent charges  
📊 *Time-based patterns* reveal fraud spikes during late mornings & early afternoons  
<br><br>


## 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Integrate *Machine Learning models* for real-time fraud prediction  
- Add *automated fraud alerts* within dashboard  
<br><br>


💡 This project showcases *end-to-end analytical skills* — from SQL-based raw data transformation to business-ready visual storytelling — making it portfolio-ready for Data Analyst roles in finance, banking, and risk management.
